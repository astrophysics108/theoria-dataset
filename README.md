# THEORIA dataset, a curated, high quality dataset of Theoretical Physics equations

THEORIA stands for Trusted Human-curated Equations Open-licensed Reproducible Itemized Archive.

> **ðŸš€ Jump in!** Weâ€™ve kicked off THEORIA with a handful of killer entries, and we need your help to grow it. If youâ€™re a theoreticalâ€‘physics buffâ€”researcher, educator, or enthusiastâ€”nowâ€™s the time to contribute your favorite equations, crisp derivations, and clear explanations.

## Why THEORIA?

There is a [lack of curated datasets](https://manuelsh.github.io/blog/2025/datasets-for-advancing-Theoretical-Physics/) with all important equations and derivations of theoretical physics to train better machine learning models, beyond raw text in papers and books.

THEORIA bridges that gap; it is the first datasets to provide a high-quality collection of theoretical physics equations, its respective derivations and explanations in a structured format.

We have an open license and encourage contributions from researchers, educators, and enthusiasts in the field of theoretical physics.

## What's inside?

Each entry in THEORIA represents a theoretical physics result â€“ for example, the Lorentz transformations.

- **High quality**: Each entry is crafted and carefully reviewed by someone with a background in physics. Contributor name or ORCID is baked into the metadata.

- **Formal derivations and annotated proofs**: AsciiMath step by step, annotated for easier understanding and programmatic formalization to guarantee correctness.

- **Selfâ€‘contained JSON files**: One entry per file under `entries/` folder, so you can fork, version, and collaborate without conflicts.

- **Domain tags**: ArXivâ€‘style categories (e.g., gr-qc, hep-th) for easy filtering.

- **Global manifest & changelog**: `manifest.json` tracks versions, file list, covered domains, and updates.

- **Open license**: `CCâ€‘BYâ€¯4.0`â€”use it, remix it, teach with it.

## How to Contribute

We are _tiny_ right now, every new entry counts! To contribute:

1. **Fork and clone**
2. **Create a JSON in `entries/`** following the instruciont in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file and the schema in `schemas/entry.schema.json`.
3. **Submit your Pull Request**. CI will automatically validate your JSON against the schema. If it passes, we will review and merge it.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Using THEORIA to train Machine Learning models

You can either use the individual JSON files or automatically generate a single merged file using a script (e.g., with `jq`):

```bash
jq -s '.' entries/*.json > dataset.json
```

Feed `dataset.json` (or perâ€‘entry files) straight into your training pipeline.
