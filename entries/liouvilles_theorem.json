  "explanation": "Liouville's theorem relates the time-averaged kinetic energy `T` and potential energy of a bound system. For particles with positions `r_i` and forces `F_i`, it states `<2T> = -<sum r_i dot F_i>`. For power-law forces, this yields simple ratios: for Newton's gravity (1/r), `<T> = -1/2 <V>`. The theorem is useful in astrophysics and molecular physics for deducing properties of equilibrated systems.",
