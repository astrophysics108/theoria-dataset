  "explanation": "Young's double slit experiment demonstrates wave interference and the wave nature of light (and matter). When coherent light passes through two parallel slits, it creates an interference pattern with alternating bright and dark fringes. This experiment is fundamental to quantum mechanics, showing wave-particle duality when performed with individual photons or electrons.",
