  "explanation": "Newton's three laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics. The First Law (Law of Inertia) states that objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force, defining inertial reference frames. The Second Law establishes that net force equals mass times acceleration, or the rate of change of momentum, providing the fundamental equation of motion. The Third Law states that forces occur in equal and opposite pairs, ensuring momentum conservation. Together, these laws enable the prediction and analysis of motion for all macroscopic objects in the classical regime.",
