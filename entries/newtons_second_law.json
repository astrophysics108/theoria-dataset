  "explanation": "Newton's second law establishes the fundamental relationship between force, mass, and acceleration in classical mechanics. It states that the net force acting on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum, or equivalently, mass times acceleration for constant mass. This law enables the prediction of motion given forces and is essential for all classical mechanical analysis, from planetary orbits to engineering design.",
