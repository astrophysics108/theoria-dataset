  "explanation": "Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) consisting of two protons and two neutrons. This process occurs in heavy nuclei to reduce their mass and achieve greater stability. The decay energy Q determines the kinetic energies of the products and governs the decay probability through quantum tunneling.",
