  "explanation": "The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a reformulation of classical mechanics as a first-order partial differential equation for the action `S(q_i, t)`. It describes the evolution of Hamilton's principal function `S` such that its spatial gradients equal the momenta. Solving the H-J equation yields `S` from which the equations of motion can be obtained, providing a bridge to wave mechanics and ultimately to Schr√∂dinger's equation.",
