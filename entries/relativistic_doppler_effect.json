  "explanation": "The relativistic Doppler effect describes the frequency shift of electromagnetic waves when the source and observer are in relative motion at relativistic speeds. Unlike the classical Doppler effect, it includes time dilation effects and is symmetric for approaching and receding motion. This effect is crucial for understanding astronomical observations, GPS satellite corrections, and particle physics experiments where high velocities are involved.",
