  "explanation": "The Hall effect occurs when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction, resulting in a voltage difference across the conductor. This effect allows determination of charge carrier density, mobility, and type (positive or negative) in materials, making it fundamental for semiconductor characterization and magnetic field sensing.",
