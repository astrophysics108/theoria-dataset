  "explanation": "Lagrangian mechanics reformulates classical mechanics using the Lagrangian function L = T - V, where T is kinetic energy and V is potential energy. The principle of stationary action states that physical systems evolve along paths that make the action S stationary. This formulation provides a powerful alternative to Newtonian mechanics, particularly useful for complex coordinate systems and constrained motion.",
