  "explanation": "The ideal-gas equation `P*V = n*R*T` links pressure, volume, mole number and temperature for a dilute gas of non-interacting point molecules. It bridges kinetic theory with classical thermodynamics, predicts gas behaviour in most laboratory conditions and anchors temperature scales. Scientists and engineers use it to size vessels, estimate densities and establish baselines before applying real-gas corrections in extreme regimes.",
