  "explanation": "The de Broglie wavelength expresses the wave-particle duality by relating the momentum of any particle to its associated wavelength. This fundamental quantum mechanical relation shows that all matter exhibits wave properties, with the wavelength inversely proportional to momentum. It enables the description of particles as waves in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding electron diffraction, atomic orbitals, and the wave function formalism.",
