        "The continuity equation expresses conservation of mass in fluid dynamics. It states that the rate of increase of density in a volume plus the net outflow of mass through the volume's boundary is zero. In incompressible flow, this reduces to `grad dot vec v = 0`. The continuity equation is fundamental for any fluid (liquid or gas).\n",
