        "Gibbs free energy is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that can be performed by a system at constant temperature and pressure. It determines the direction of spontaneous processes: reactions proceed when Î”G < 0. This function is fundamental in chemistry, materials science, and phase transitions.\n",
