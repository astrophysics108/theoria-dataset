        "The Bose-Einstein distribution describes the statistical distribution of bosons (particles with integer spin) in thermal equilibrium. Unlike fermions, bosons can occupy the same quantum state with no restriction, leading to phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation and stimulated emission. This distribution is fundamental for understanding photons, phonons, and superfluid behavior.\n",
