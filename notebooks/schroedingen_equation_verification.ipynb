        "The time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation governs the non-relativistic evolution of a quantum particle's wavefunction Ïˆ(x,t). By promoting energy and momentum to differential operators, it relates the temporal derivative of Ïˆ to the kinetic (âˆ’Ä§Â²/2mâˆ‡Â²) and potential (V) terms. It's the foundational equation of quantum mechanics, determining probabilities and dynamics of microscopic systems.\n",
