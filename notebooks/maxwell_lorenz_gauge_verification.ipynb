        "In Lorenz gauge, Maxwell's equations for the scalar (phi) and vector (vec A) electromagnetic potentials reduce to decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations driven by charge and current densities. These forms make the causal propagation of electromagnetic influences explicit, simplify relativistic formulations, and are widely used in field quantisation and numerical electrodynamics.\n",
