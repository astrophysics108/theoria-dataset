        "The Vis-Viva equation relates the velocity of a particle in an elliptical, hyperbolic or parabolic orbit to the distance to the barycenter, mass of the body it's orbiting, and the semi-major axis of the orbit. This sets the basis for velocity calculations in non-circular orbits and allows us to later derive equations like the equation for escape velocity with ease.\n",
