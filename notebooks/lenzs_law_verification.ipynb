        "Lenz's law states that the direction of an induced current is such that its magnetic field opposes the change in flux that produced it. This law is a manifestation of energy conservation in electromagnetic systems, ensuring that induced currents always act to resist changes in magnetic flux, requiring work to maintain the changing flux.\n",
