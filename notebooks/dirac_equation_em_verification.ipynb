        "The Dirac equation with minimal coupling to the electromagnetic four-potential extends the free-particle equation to describe spin-1/2 fermions interacting with external fields. By replacing space-time derivatives with gauge-covariant ones, it incorporates electric and magnetic interactions while preserving Lorentz covariance and gauge invariance, forming the quantum-mechanical cornerstone of quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n",
