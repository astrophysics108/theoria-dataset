        "Carnot efficiency represents the maximum theoretical efficiency of any heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. It depends only on the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, establishing an upper limit that no real heat engine can exceed. This efficiency is achieved by the reversible Carnot cycle and is fundamental to understanding the second law of thermodynamics.\n",
