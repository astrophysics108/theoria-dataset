        "The incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equation balances transient and convective inertia with pressure gradients, viscous diffusion and body forces in a Newtonian fluid. As the fundamental dynamical law for liquids and gases at everyday speeds, it captures phenomena from laminar pipe flow to atmospheric turbulence. Solutions underpin aerospace design, blood-flow modelling and numerous industrial processes.\n",
