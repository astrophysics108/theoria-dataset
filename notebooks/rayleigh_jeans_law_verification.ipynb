        "The Rayleigh-Jeans law describes the classical limit of blackbody radiation for long wavelengths (low frequencies), where the energy density is proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength. This classical result agrees with experiments at long wavelengths but fails catastrophically at short wavelengths, leading to the ultraviolet catastrophe that motivated Planck's quantum theory of radiation.\n",
