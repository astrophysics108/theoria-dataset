        "The Biot-Savart law calculates the magnetic field produced by a steady current. It states that the magnetic field contribution from a current element is proportional to the current, the length element, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This law is fundamental for calculating magnetic fields from arbitrary current distributions.\n",
