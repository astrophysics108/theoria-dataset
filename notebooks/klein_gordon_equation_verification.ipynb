        "The Klein-Gordon equation is a relativistic wave equation that describes spinless particles. It was the first attempt to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity, predating the Dirac equation. The equation naturally arises when applying quantum mechanics' energy-momentum relation to relativistic particles, and it correctly predicts both positive and negative energy solutions.\n",
