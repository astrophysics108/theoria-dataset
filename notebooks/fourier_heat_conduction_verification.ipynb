        "Fourier's conduction law states that heat-flux density `vec{q}` is proportional to the negative temperature gradient, `vec{q} = -k*nabla T`. It defines thermal conductivity, leads directly to the heat-diffusion equation and quantifies how rapidly solids or stationary fluids conduct heat. Engineers apply it to rate insulation, design heat exchangers and simulate geothermal or electronic cooling problems.\n",
