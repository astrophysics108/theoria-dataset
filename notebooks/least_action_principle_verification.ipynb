        "The principle of least action states that the path taken by a physical system between two configurations is the one that makes the action stationary. The action is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian function. This principle provides a unified foundation for classical mechanics and leads directly to the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion.\n",
