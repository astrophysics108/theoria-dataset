        "Electromagnetic waves are self-propagating oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that travel at the speed of light. They result from Maxwell's equations and include visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The wave equation shows that EM disturbances propagate at speed c = 1/âˆš(Î¼â‚€Îµâ‚€).\n",
