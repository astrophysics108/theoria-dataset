        "The Rydberg formula describes the wavelengths of spectral lines in hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms. It predicts the wavelength of light emitted when an electron transitions between energy levels, with the wavenumber proportional to the difference in inverse squares of the principal quantum numbers. This empirical formula, discovered before quantum mechanics, provided crucial evidence for quantized energy levels in atoms and laid the foundation for atomic spectroscopy.\n",
