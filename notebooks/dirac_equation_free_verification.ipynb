        "The Dirac equation is a first-order relativistic wave equation that consistently describes spin-1/2 particles such as electrons. By linearly combining space-time derivatives with the Dirac gamma matrices, it reconciles quantum mechanics with special relativity while predicting intrinsic spin and the existence of antiparticles. It underpins relativistic quantum mechanics and is a cornerstone of quantum field theory for fermions.\n",
