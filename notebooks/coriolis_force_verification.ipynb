        "The Coriolis force is a fictitious force that appears in a rotating reference frame. It causes moving objects to be deflected relative to the Earth's surface or any rotating frame. The Coriolis acceleration is `2(vec v cross vec Omega)`, acting perpendicular to the velocity. This effect explains phenomena like the rotation of cyclones and the deflection of projectiles in latitude.\n",
